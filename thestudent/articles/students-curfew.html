          <div class="mainText">
            
            
            <p><span class="firstLetter">T</span>he widely enforced solution that many institutions have currently opted for in dealing with sexual harassment is the curfew rule, which restricts female students from leaving the hostel premises after a fixed time period. It is assumed that women can avoid sexual harassment that lingers late at night by being locked up within safe boundaries.</p>
            <p>While men are allowed to roam freely, this rule is highly discriminatory, sexist, and hinders the progression of women in Indian institutions. In colleges where the curfew is as low as 7, women are unable to actively participle in student body and project meetings that are usually conducted at night after classes. This immobilizes them from having leadership positions and being part of key projects, resulting in a more male dominant environment and further making it worse in representing the women&rsquo;s best interests in college.</p>
            <p>The idea of the curfew rule is fundamentally inane because it resorts to an oppressive structure where safety is ensured at the cost of fundamental liberties. It might be argued that this is a preventive measure, but however, it is far from progressive. By having this rule strictly in place, universities lack any further incentive in dealing with the issue of sexual harassment. If progressive measures are not adopted, dangers will continue to lurk in the society and the solution will be incessantly deemed to be the suppressive curfew rule.</p>
            <p>Rather counterintuitively, when we consider the bigger picture, the curfew actually does the exact opposite of ensuring safety. Since the curfew considers women as beings that need to be protected from men, it enforces a protectionist ideology which is completely based on male superiority, and this male dominance when left unaddressed—and seen as something that women need to be protected from—only leads to more fear and threat.</p>
            <p>Many institutions are still pertaining to the curfew rule because of its ease of implementation. It is much easier to restrict students within concrete walls than fight head-on against societal factors that threaten their security (same can be said for ragging, where some institutions impose curfews for juniors rather than regulating the seniors). This should be condemned, as we cannot afford to put civil rights at stake just for the sake of simplicity in execution.</p>
            <blockquote>
              <h3>
              <p>
                Many institutions are still pertaining to the curfew rule because of its ease of implementation; it is much easier to restrict students within concrete walls than fight head-on against societal factors that threaten their security.
              </p>
              </h3>
            </blockquote>
            <p>It has been <a href="https://girijaborker.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/borker_jmp.pdf" target="_blank">studied</a> that women in Delhi pick lower ranked colleges than the ones that they're eligible for, primarily due to safety concerns. Do we allow this trend to continue just because women are now deemed safer, or do we work in developing an environment where women are freely allowed to pursue their&nbsp;goals without worrying about safety? Clearly, the answer is in the latter. The same applies for the curfew; we can no longer let the curfew persist and put women in a position where they have to choose between their fundamental rights and safety.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>The goal of institutions should be to make a woman feel safe by empowering her, not restricting her. It is essential that universities look towards measures that invigorate and equip each and every female student with a strong and publicly known ability to ensure justice. This would firmly instill in every predatory mind the idea that he/she will be put on trial if obscene acts were to be committed, and it could inhibit such crimes altogether.</p>
            <blockquote>
              <h3>
              <p>
                The goal of institutions should be to make a woman feel safe by empowering her, not restricting her.
              </p>
              </h3>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Many female students have experienced some sort of sexual harassment during cultural and technical festivals. Yet, no effective institutional measures are being taken up to tackle this dire issue; this trend keeps continuing and the harassers are hardly brought to justice because they're usually not students of the college. Claiming that it is unsafe for women to stay for late night fests, the curfew might again be pitted as the panacea. But where is this taking us? Nowhere. The real problem of harassment lurking on campus is left unaddressed, and women are the only ones who are detrimentally affected here as they are unable to participate in late night events.</p>
            <p>The most rational measure here would be to increase the number of security personnel. This would ensure a safe campus where women aren't immobilized, and harassers are curbed and brought to justice.</p>
            <p>Various instances in colleges throughout the nation where women fail to promptly receive the appropriate justice, gravely calls for a dismantling of the current power hierarchy. Female students should be given equal power, resources, and jurisdiction to take the immediate course of action when dealing with issues that threaten their security. The student community needs to be more sovereign and autonomous so that problems are actively dealt with and actions are taken in the best interest of the students. Judicial bodies in colleges should empower female students to have a strong voice when choosing what cases should be put forth and deciding the verdict of any given case.</p>
            <blockquote>
              <h3>
              <p>
                Female students should be given equal power, resources, and jurisdiction to take the immediate course of action when dealing with issues that threaten their security.
              </p>
              </h3>
            </blockquote>

            <p>The Internal Complaints Committee (ICC), the women&rsquo;s grievance cell that should be present in every university as mandated by the UGC, has been reported to be very ineffective in various institutions. Many committees even lack the mandatory appointment of three student representatives. The UGC should step up and play its role in ensuring whether universities are adhering to its laws and make sure that student representatives are being elected so that there is democratic conduct when dealing with problems concerning women&rsquo;s safety.</p>
            <p>But it is not only women and government bodies who have to battle the issue of sexual harassment. Both female and male faculty also need to step up in sensitizing this issue and bringing forth awareness on a larger scale throughout the campus. Male students also need to aid their fellow female peers in dialogues and actions regarding this pressing issue.</p>
            <p>With frightening  <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/50-increase-in-sexual-harassment-cases-on-campuses-in-2017-minister/articleshow/63383234.cms" target="_blank">reports</a> stating that there&rsquo;s been 50% increase in sexual harassment cases in universities, the call is louder now than ever before for universities to revise existing policies and look for more effective measures to deal with sexual harassment. The time has come to answer a question that demands an urgent solution: Are we going to adopt policies that foster a safe nation where women lead as equals alongside men, or continue to oppress them at the cost of their progression in the name of safety?</p>
