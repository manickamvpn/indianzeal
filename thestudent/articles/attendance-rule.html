          <div class="mainText">
            <p><span class="firstLetter">W</span>hen you walk into a classroom in any Indian college, you&rsquo;re bound to find two things in common. First, you&rsquo;d probably find the students in the first two benches scribbling notes while meticulously listening to the lecturer. Second, you&rsquo;d find that the rest of the students are obliviously present there solely for one golden reason that has induced even the laziest of sloths to come to class: attendance.</p>
<p>Attendance has been a matter of great importance in any Indian student&rsquo;s life. Since there is a strict requirement of minimum 75% attendance to appear for the final examinations in most of the Indian institutions, students strenuously try to satisfy this criterion without fail. Being a college student myself, I can say with confidence that a huge chunk of the academic facet of college life does not revolve around gathering course material or interacting with professors, but primarily comprises of fulfilling this rote criterion that has rocked the Indian student community ever since it&rsquo;s inception.</p>
<p>The foremost motive behind the rule is to provide an incentive for students in coming to class and learning what is being taught on a regular basis. It also makes the institution feel safe in ensuring that its students are consistently taking part in the academic process. But in reality, how effective is this compulsive policy in making students learn with rigor?</p>
<p>This rule is pretty effectual in making students show up for class, but it fails to achieve the main goal of making students learn. Most of the minds still wander about and are still unaware of what is being taught. Some of them even resort to doodling, talking with fellow classmates, and if nothing works out, sleeping is always the dernier ressort.</p>
<blockquote>
              <h3>
              <p>
                This rule is pretty effectual in making students show up for class, but it fails to achieve the main goal of making students learn.
              </p>
              </h3>
            </blockquote>
<p>The problem here is that the incentive has shifted from willingly attending class out of interest to forcefully gratifying the system&rsquo;s rule. One&rsquo;s incentive to learn should arise from curiosity rather than compulsion. This way, what is being taught is strongly woven into the mental fabric of the student both in the short and long run. But sadly, the question has moved from &ldquo;What am I going to learn today in class today?&rdquo; to &ldquo;How many classes can I skip today so that I can maintain my attendance?&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote>
              <h3>
              <p>
                One&rsquo;s incentive to learn should arise from curiosity rather than compulsion. This way, what is being taught is strongly woven into the mental fabric of the student both in the short and long run.
              </p>
              </h3>
            </blockquote>
<p>It is often assumed that students will stop showing up if the mandatory attendance were to be removed. However, this would not be the case if the information being imparted in class is crucial and is delivered in a graspable manner. Students would then automatically place a high value on what is being done in class and it could ultimately lead to an organic increase in attendance.</p>
<p>Scraping the attendance rule could give rise to a reflective measure to assess the performance of a certain lecturer. If students are still showing up for class even without the attendance rule complying them to do so, it could mean that the lecturer is in fact effective in teaching, and what is being taught is absorbed properly and can be used when the student is being tested. On the contrary, if the turnout is drastically low, the lecturer is given feedback to reinvent his method and style of teaching such that the class is more interesting and as a result, more students would be willing to show up for the lecturer&rsquo;s class. By changing our perspective by shifting the microscope&rsquo;s focus from the student to the lecturer, we could actively improve the teaching process such that the student remains interested in the subject. The goal then wouldn&rsquo;t be to forcefully actuate students to attend class, but to improve the quality of teaching so that students become naturally interested and voluntarily take part in the classroom.</p>
<blockquote>
              <h3>
              <p>
                If students are still showing up for class even without the attendance rule complying them to do so, it could mean that the lecturer is in fact effective in teaching, and what is being taught is absorbed properly and can be used when the student is being tested.
              </p>
              </h3>
            </blockquote>
<p>Apart from the lack of fostering a genuine interest in the respective subjects, the Indian education system—which is already regarded to be broken when it comes to learning life skills—aggravates the problem by disconnecting the student from the community and its affairs by imposing such a high mandatory attendance policy. Since the majority of the student&rsquo;s time is being exhausted in satisfying this criterion, the students are immobilized from learning the crucial life skills that are essential in the workplace and beyond. College life has become highly academic centric, and students lack the flexibility to explore what the real world has to offer.</p>
<p>Universities are often perceived as sanctities that prep the students for the real world, so it is essential that students are empowered with the autonomy for experiential learning and facing the harsh realities of life.</p>
<p>Rather than resorting to an oppressive structure, Indian universities should focus more on policies that induce curiosity and intrinsically motivate students to take part in the academic process. It is vital that the goal of institutions changes to producing sovereign individuals motivated by an interest in their fields, rather than continuing to produce mere robots driven by the forceful rules of the system.</p>
