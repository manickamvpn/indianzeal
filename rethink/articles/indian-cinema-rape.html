            <p><span class="firstLetter">I</span>ndian cinema is pretty hard to fathom. Despite its general lack of scientific grounding and hackneyed use of the masala element, it still manages to make us flock to the theaters to watch our favourite actors beat up ten (or even a hundred, depending upon the fury of the hero) guys at once. Who can blame us? The &ldquo;mass&rdquo; slow-mo walks are just too hard to resist. However, there&rsquo;s a certain cinematic tool that is being used repetitively to invoke emotions in the viewer—a tool that is refusing to disappear from Indian cinema and is covertly hindering societal progression through insinuations: rape.</p>
<p>I'd recently watched a Tamil film and to no one's surprise, it was the whole "woman gets raped-hero gets fired up-bashes the rowdies-the end" all over again. In spite of its monotony, it still managed to garner the claps from a satisfied crowd, not to mention a good online rating, something which I found very hard to understand. In an artistic sense, aren't we tired of this one-liner plot? Why do we still watch?</p>
<p>Confused by how such clich&eacute;s still thrive, once the movie was over, I had asked a nearby viewer who was previously whistling throughout the film why he liked it so much, to which he ardently replied, "I was fired up. I was emotional throughout the movie, and I liked that."</p>
<p>Though fictitious, there seems to be a euphoria that we all get when we see that justice is being served—especially for a monstrous crime such as rape for which most of us have a strong sentiment against. When rape is portrayed as the major conflict, we remain engrossed in the film and want to avenge the victim as vigorously as the hero wants to. This captivates us until the very end of the movie.</p>
<p>But most of us fail to realise that this engagement gimmick comes at an opaque social cost.</p>
<p>In some cases where rape might not be a major conflict, sexual aggression is still used as a cinematic tool whereby the antagonist is portrayed to harass the hero's closest female friends and family to further inflame the hero. Most of the women's roles in these films do not extend beyond being a lover to the hero and a victim to the villain.</p>
<p>Although presented in a fictional form, the recurrent pattern of men avenging and protecting women fuels the already existing Indian prejudice that women need to be protected, especially by men. This presents a roadblock in working towards a gender-equal society because we are constantly encouraged by films—intentionally or inadvertently—to think that one sex needs to play the hero while the other is in desperate need of such heroism.</p>

<p>"Don't be so feminist, bro. They're just films", my friend tells me as I write this piece. Many of us often tend to undermine the power of cinematic story-telling on societal perceptions.&nbsp;It is high time that we realise that there could many cultural expressions underpinning these films that could be detrimental to societal progression.&nbsp;To conclude that these films are just works of fiction and hence do not affect the real world would be highly one dimensional.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cinema tends to have a significant impact on young children and adolescents. For example, watching tobacco use in Bollywood was found to be&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3420563/" target="_blank" shape="rect">associated with ever tobacco use among adolescents in India</a>. Similarly,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.commonsensemedia.org/blog/gender-stereotypes-are-messing-with-your-kid" target="_blank" shape="rect">a Common Sense Media study</a>&nbsp;observed that gender stereotypes that are portrayed in films can have serious consequences on kids' self-esteem and relationships. So if this is the case, it is important to consider what kind of message is sent to Indian children when they are constantly bombarded with rape-centric films that hegomonize men and victimize women. Aren't we risking&nbsp;young girls believing that they need to be constantly protected and are nothing but elements of games between men? Or young boys believing that they are superior to their female counterparts?</p>

<p><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/232454315_The_Socio-Cultural_Context_of_Rape_A_Cross-Cultural_Study" target="_blank" shape="rect">Studies</a>&nbsp;have shown us that the incidence of rape is higher in cultures that have embedded male-dominance and an ideology of toughness in men and weakness in women. Incessant use of rape as a cinematic tool, and the portrayal of rape as a game between men, and women as the game's victims, amplifies this ideology of toughness which may contribute to a social construct that might contribute to a social construct that is supportive of a rape culture. Counterintuitively, fictitious justice for rape portrayed in this manner could actually propel the longstanding rape culture in our country.</p>
<p>While this issue certainly does demand the attention and action of producers and film-makers, a huge chunk of the responsibility also lies with the viewers. After all, the incessant demand for these rape-centric films is what keeps them on the run. It is high time that we realise the covert repercussions—which if left untended can have grave consequences on young minds, and hinder societal progression by sustaining primitive stereotypes. </p>
