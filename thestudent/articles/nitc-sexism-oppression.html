            <p><span class="firstLetter">N</span>ITs are deemed to be some of the best and most prestigious universities in the country. While these colleges maintain their top rankings for their academic record, something that is often overlooked by both government bodies and prospective students is the socio-cultural health of these colleges, for example, the limits of students’ freedom of speech; how gender-equal the campus tends to be; and whether students’ problems and concerns are represented in a just fashion. NIT Calicut (NITC), the public technological institution in Kerala, has repetitively failed in this regard, and as a result, has sustained an oppressive and sexist institutional culture that often tends to escape the public radar. </p>
<h3><b>NITC: The Poster Child For Gender Inequality?</b></h3>
<p>Over the years, NITC has adopted measures that have often misrepresented women and has repetitively failed to establish a gender-equal campus. There have been a myriad of instances where female students have been denied their basic rights and liberties, and in some cases, even the appropriate justice that they deserve.</p>


<h4><b>Letting go of a professor guilty of sexual harassment</b></h4>
<p>In 2014, TOI had <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kozhikode/NITC-lets-off-guilty-prof-with-warning/articleshow/34659859.cms" target="_blank">reported</a> that NIT Calicut had let go of Dr. P. Predeep, a physics professor who was guilty of sexual harassment, with a mere warning. The reasoning behind the action was that it was the professors "first" time, hence the decided punishment was limited. NITC had chosen to ignore both the counsel of the legal court and the institute's Woman Complainant Cell (WCC), both which vouched for serious action against the professor. Even worse, it was reported that NITC had sat on the detailed inquiry by the institute's WCC for 8 months before issuing even a warning letter. It was also alleged that Dr. P. Predeep threatened to physically assault then Registrar, and Dean (Research and Consultancy) if the warning letter wasn't withdrawn within the next 24 hours.</p>

<p>Dr. P. Predeep is currently the Head Of Physics Department of NITC.</p>
<blockquote>
              <h3>
              <p>
                It was reported that the institute had sat on the detailed inquiry by the institute's WCC for 8 months before issuing even a warning letter.
              </p>
              </h3>
            </blockquote>
<br>

<h4><b>The Sexist Notice</b></h4>
<p>Further proving NITC's institutional hostility towards appropriate female representation, in 2016, a warden of the institute&rsquo;s ladies&rsquo; hostel, Dr. S. Bhuvaneswari, had issued a notice that strictly instructed female students not to roam around boys, and stated &lsquo;If any girl found along with boy students inside residential campus, severe action will be taken against her including suspension and expulsion from hostel.&rsquo;
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">NIT Calicut is going back in time instead of forward. Threat of suspension from hostel if a girl is found with roaming with a boy. <a href="https://t.co/nhg5ijXNUu">pic.twitter.com/nhg5ijXNUu</a></p>&mdash; Kozhikoden Manyu (@abhimanyuma) <a href="https://twitter.com/abhimanyuma/status/801310579235389440?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 23, 2016</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</p>


<p>The notice was issued in response to pranks played by both male and female students in the residential campus, which had supposedly caused trouble for the faculties residing there. Both boys and girls were at fault, but the female students were the only ones who received a notice.</p>

<p>Though the notice was then taken down amidst the backlash from certain faculties and the district collector, Dr. S. Bhuvaneshwari still remains a warden of the hostel, reflecting the institute&rsquo;s strong tolerance towards blatant sexism.</p>

<h4><b>Forceful Implementation Of The BAS</b></h4>
<p>Three years after the notice was issued, in perhaps the most recent incident, in early 2019, the ladies' hostel was hit with another sexist rule that mandated inmates to submit their fingerprints for the proposed biometric attendance system (BAS). When students opposed this rule on the grounds that it was highly discriminatory (because there was no BAS for the boys) and had various legal violations, they were shunned, with wardens—including Dr. S. Bhuvaneshwari—making statements such as "This is not the platform to address gender equality", and refusing to properly heed the students' legal concerns. The students, however, did not give up. They continued to protest by mass boycotting the data collection for the BAS, hence stalling it's implementation until they met with a committee comprising of the respective authorities, including the director. The meeting was supposed to have discussions not just regarding the biometric system, but the very perpetuation of the ladies' curfew which currently stands at 9 PM.</p>

<p>But the meeting, as it turns out, was just another fiasco. When the curfew was rationally challenged by student representatives, the committee was quick in responding with prejudiced statements such as "I have been your age, I know what you people will do", and "Girls and boys will be roaming around, is that what you want?". The committee had then firmly established that the institute will never give in to the students' curfew demands.</p>

<p>The current position on the implementation of the biometric system seems vague. Some students claim that it will be implemented in the upcoming semester, and if students continue to oppose it, they will not be allowed to stay in the institutes' hostels. Some were unsure what the next course of action was, and some refused to comment on the issue.</p>
<h3><b>Restricting Free Speech and Curbing Dissent</b></h3>

<p>When students do speak up against misconduct or question the functionings of the bureaucracy, NITC has had an extant practice of curtailing such demurrals. There have been various instances in the institute&rsquo;s history where the administration in power has resorted to oppressive measures to curb free speech in order to protect its beliefs and actions and prevent further aggravation of its ignorance and wrongdoings.</p>

<h4><b>The 2014 Wall Controversy</b></h4>
<p>Perhaps the biggest case of NITC's autocratic conduct was the repression of student protests that ensued in 2014 when a tennis wall had collapsed and lead to the death of a 19-year-old physically challenged student. It was alleged that the NITC administration had quashed multiple complaints filed by both senior faculties and students regarding the bad condition and frailty of the wall. After the collapse, accusing the administration of criminal negligence, the students at the time had taken it to the streets demanding that action be taken against the concerned authorities. To curb these protests, the administration had resorted to extreme measures by closing the institution and ordering thousands of students to vacate the institute's hostels within a matter of a few hours. It was only when the students had aired their grievances to Shashi Tharoor—then MHRD minister—was the order struck down and nullified. Tharoor, in a response to a student's plea via Twitter, had called the order 'irresponsible' and said that he had countermanded it.
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/rohitawasthi?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@rohitawasthi</a> have countermanded this irresponsible order today. Students can return to hostel.</p>&mdash; Shashi Tharoor (@ShashiTharoor) <a href="https://twitter.com/ShashiTharoor/status/435854017814474752?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 18, 2014</a></blockquote>

</p>
<br>
<h4><b>How The Suppressive Culture is Still Being Perpetuated</b></h4>
<p>The suppressive culture still seems to be continuing after all these years. When a student representing the Zeal had recently filed an RTI requesting information on the status of the institute's supercomputer—which currently has no mention in the institute's websites—he was informed by the authority in charge of the facility, Dr. Jayaraj P.B, through an intermediary that there will be repercussions if any more RTIs were to be filed. Dr. Jayaraj had stated, among many other intimidating implications, "Answering his RTI, I lost my 1 hour. If that is his motive, I will also respond when I get time".</p>
<blockquote>
              <h3>
              <p>
                "Answering his RTI, I lost my 1 hour. If that is his motive, I will also respond when I get time".
              </p>
              </h3>
            </blockquote>

<p>Many students who are currently studying at the institute have shared their experiences when they were picked up by their professors in class, who'd intentionally reduce their grades just because they were involved in a protest or some other activity that was frowned upon by the administration. Adding to that, female students have been publicly slut-shamed when they have requested for curfew extensions; screenings on Rohith Vemula and menstruation have been canceled without reason; LGBTQ week, a yearly event conducted by the institute's queer community that has talks and events discussing how the campus can be more inclusive, was canceled as authorities deemed it "negative" and "unnecessary". The institute's current Dean of Student Welfare, Dr. S. D. Madhukumar, had stated the administration cannot allow the "promotion of homosexuality", though the events only centered around acknowledging the existence of the community in the campus and increasing awareness.</p>
<blockquote>
              <h3>
              <p>
                Events that focused on increasing awareness on homosexuality were canceled as the institute's authorities deemed it "negative" and "unnecessary".
              </p>
              </h3>
            </blockquote>
  <p>While NITC has had a substantial climb from 50th to 28th position in the 2019 NIRF rankings, its record in terms of student freedom and liberalism remains an issue only within the campus’ student community and is hardly discussed in a larger context. Whether the administration will change its primitive views in accordance with a larger public consciousness of its draconian policies is yet to be seen.</p>
