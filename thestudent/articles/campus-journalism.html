          <div class="mainText">
            <p><span class="firstLetter">C</span>olleges are essentially supposed to be mini-democracies, as there exists a central authority—the college administration—and individuals with fundamental rights—the students. However, many administrations fail to look at their students in a representative manner. Rather, they are often treated like children, as faculties often resort to a paternalistic view of how students should be governed. Since there exists this condescending attitude, what the central authority believes and decides is forced upon the students whose opinions and perspectives are hardly solicited.</p>
<p>This needs to change, as students are major individuals whose interests and rights must be represented in a democratic manner. Students must be empowered with the ability that allows them to dissent and put forth their different perspectives and ideas. Implementing newspapers or any journalistic medium could be a great start on that front, as it would open the gates for students to have discussions and critique institutional measures on a public forum. Just like how journalists are considered to be the watchdogs of national democracies, student journalists should be given similar power and the independency to question, investigate, and challenge administrative authority.</p>

<h3><b>Journalistic Media As A Catalyst</b></h3>
<p>There have been various instances where students have failed to get prompt justice for their grievances. Such is the case especially for female students who file complaints regarding sexual harassment, as there have been multiple incidents where colleges have had laggardly conduct and have refused to actively and quickly respond to such complaints. There are other channels where students are misrepresented too; cases of verbal abuse, grading partiality, and sexism aren't uncommon. Such cases of malpractices need to be called out, and above all, it needs to be done under the public eye, through the journalistic medium. When administrative negligence&nbsp;is put under public consciousness, the resulting scrutiny would pressurize authorities in heeding students' concerns in a prompt and active fashion.</p>
          <blockquote>

<h3><b>Improving the curriculum through student feedback</b></h3>
<p>One of the reasons why our education system is considered to be broken is because there is no sufficient spotlight on the opinions of the very individuals who are on the receiving end: the students. There exists a lack of feedback, making it difficult to assess if the education being imparted is actually effectual or completely outdated and useless. The only way to rectify this is to amplify students' opinions about what they feel about the education system that could be rectified, and one of the ways to do this is to encourage advocacy journalism in campus that allows students to put forth their anecdotal experiences and perspectives concerning how education is being imparted. Implementing an official large scale campus newspaper would make it easier for students to do this, and would allow policymakers to patently heed students' concerns and ideas.</p>

            </blockquote>
<br>
<h3><b> Encouraging Mainstream Media To Pick Up Student Issues </b></h3>
<p>An official campus newspaper could also serve as a credible source of campus news, hence making it easier for the mainstream media to pick up important student issues and amplify it for a larger audience. This way, what needs to be discussed about on a larger scale is done so without being ignored on the grounds of credibility.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><b>The Decisive Point: Independancy</b></h3>
<p>While various institutions do have student run-magazines and newspapers, there exists a lack of independency. They are often meticulously watched and controlled by faculty editors, hence discouraging dissent that is unfavorable towards the administration. Independency of any journalistic media is key for it to work effectively; just like how media in a national democracy must not be under the control of political systems for its effective functioning, campus journalism must not be under the oversight of the&nbsp;governors—which is the administration—but the governed: the students.&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
              <h3>
              <p>
                Campus journalism must not be under the oversight of the&nbsp;governors—which is the administration—but the governed: the students.
              </p>
              </h3>
            </blockquote>
<p>A university that refuses to have an independent media body cannot be termed democratic in any way. If an institution were to deem itself as a just representative of its students, it must make an independent media body an essential component of the institute’s constitution. A truly democratic institution must, at all costs, equip its students with the power to challenge the functioning of college administrations. Also of equal importance is the willingness on part of students to step up and actively play a part in institutional decisions, and to make sure that the interests of the community are being represented in a just manner. A journalistic medium is one of the only ways students can independently ensure that their interests and concerns are being addressed. </p>
