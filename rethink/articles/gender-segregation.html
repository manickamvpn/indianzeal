            <p><span class="firstLetter">"S</span>tay away from boys!", warned her mother when she stepped out for school.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Why are you sitting with a girl?", questioned his professor, with a hint of murky dubiousness.</p>
<p>Adulthood wasn't any different either. His relatives would judge him as being disloyal to his wife if he had too many female friends. And for her, well. You know how it is.</p>
<p>This traditional obsession that expects men and women to be separate entities has been around for a long time now. Although certain sections of the populace - especially the urban ones - have embraced a gender diverse environment where there is free interaction between men and women, a large part of the country still believe it to be a western concept and as something that is intolerable.</p>
<p>Gender segregation first begins on the institutional level in many schools and colleges, including co-ed, where male and female students are often&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/colleges-offer-disciplinary-measures-instead-of-security-measures/article4284051.ece">prevented from sitting or talking</a>&nbsp;with each other.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.telegraphindia.com/states/jharkhand/co-ed-college-mocks-gender-freedom-st-xavier-s-discovers-study-planet-for-girls-after-delhi-rape-boys-cry-insult/cid/343683#.VGSGiPmUc9Q">Some colleges</a>&nbsp;have even gone as far as introducing sex-based staircases.</p>
<p>There exists this ingrained assumption among many Indian traditionalists that male and female&nbsp;interaction, especially in the adolescent stages, ultimately has a romantic or sexual motive, which is often perceived as a threat to many Indian cultures that uphold inter-case marriages and discourage pre-marital relationships. This is often used as a reason to sustain a culture of gender separation.</p>

<p>But most of us fail to grasp that behind this prejudiced rationale for segregating sexes, there exist many factors that hinder societal progression as a whole.</p>
<p>Sex separation can adversely affect young minds who are actively seeking to understand the world by being open to what is shown to them. Children tend to pick up stereotypes quite easily, and in a stereotype prevalent environment like ours, the culture of sex separation might prove to be detrimental to societal progression. A&nbsp;<a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/03055698.2012.760442?src=recsys&amp;journalCode=ceds20">study</a>&nbsp;conducted with a sample of 365 seventh grade students had found that the more gender-segregated class the children took, the more gender stereotyped they were in their responding. It concluded that &ldquo;GS (gender segregation) likely heightens the salience of gender in the classroom thereby reinforcing and increasing gender stereotypes&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Young boys may internalize sexist stereotypes often used to justify male dominance if they aren&rsquo;t allowed to freely interact with their female counterparts and see them as equals in an inclusive society. Similarly, young girls could be dispirited by pervasive sexist male-dominant ideologies if they aren&rsquo;t allowed to step up and take part in activities alongside boys as parallels.</p>
<blockquote>
              <h3>
              <p>

              </p>
              </h3>
            </blockquote>
<p>Another problem is that gender segregation at the young and adolescent stages might be a hindrance in the long run: given that an increasing number of women are entering the workplace now more than ever before, it is of paramount importance that we foster a work environment where there is effective cooperation between the sexes. Isolating the sexes at a phase when they are supposed to learn how to interact freely only leads to a lack of communication skills at a period when they need it most. </p>

              <h3>

              </p>
              </h3>
            </blockquote>
<p>Patriarchal&nbsp;social constructs have been a major hindrance to women empowerment in the country. To break the patriarchy and transition towards a gender-equal society, we first need to break the gender stereotypes that have been so deeply drilled into social perceptions. But it becomes immensely difficult to break these stereotypes when we segregate sexes. Stereotypes continue to persist because men remain in their stereotype-driven paradigms and women in theirs. If we don&rsquo;t allow sexes to interact and challenge each others&rsquo; preconceived notions on gender roles and identities, stereotypes will remain undisputed. The&nbsp;key then is integration, not isolation.</p>
<p>Safety is sometimes used as a reason to separate men and women. This is evident in public transport, where separate sections are reserved for women. This form of isolation may be a short term solution, but it doesn't address the main issue; all it does is perpetuate existing stereotypes that women are the vulnerable gender and need to be protected. The goal is not to make women feel safe by separating them from men, but to ensure safety in a society where they are allowed to roam freely and are able to access public spaces the same way that men do.&nbsp;</p>
            <blockquote>
              <h3>
              <p>
                The goal is not to make women feel safe by separating them from men, but to ensure safety in a society where they are allowed to roam freely and are able to access public spaces the same way that men do.
              </p>
              </h3>
            </blockquote>

<p>Ultimately, the power to eliminate this regressive paradigm lies with three key central figures: the parents, teachers, and professors. They are partly the main roles that are responsible for perpetuating a segregated culture as the norm; it is the parent who strains on same-sex peers; the teacher who prevents young children from talking to each other irrespective of one's sex; and the professor who hinders free interaction between young adults. It is high time that we push ourselves and these figures to realize the resulting social consequences and come to terms with the fact that when we separate the sexes in the name of distancing “sexual intentions”, the only thing we end up distancing is our society from more inclusion and solidarity. </p>
