            <p><span class="firstLetter">E</span>veryone&rsquo;s talking about it. Activists are lauding it. Kejriwal&rsquo;s got back the spotlight for his ambitious new plan to make the metros free for women.</p>
<p>But the economics of the plan is often missed in mainstream discourses. Sure, it could greatly aid in getting more women into the workforce, which is a great thing, but it would be irrational of us to overlook the feasibility of such a plan and just concentrate on the outcome. By ignoring the consequences involved, we are at risk of compromising the effective functioning of the metro itself.</p>
<p>First off, nothing is free. Freebies sanctioned by politicians may look attractive, but it involves various economic complications that it could actually end up being detrimental to the citizenry. This is commonly known as the &ldquo;free lunch&rdquo; myth.</p>
<h3><b>Costs on those who do pay</b></h3>
<p>Delhi government has stated that it will &ldquo;buy&rdquo; the tickets for women, indicating that it will not lead to any price fluctuations for other riders. On the surface, it is tempting to state that there is no cost incurred by other riders if we were to implement Kejriwal&rsquo;s plan. But that depends on how you define cost. Increased monetary costs? No. But what about waiting time? Isn&rsquo;t that a cost too?</p>
<p>When you make the metros free for women, it will imminently lead to a drastic increase in footfall, causing more congestion. This would present itself as a burden on those who do pay, who now have to wait much longer than they had to.</p>
<p>Economist call this the &lsquo;free rider&rsquo; problem, which arises when people take excessive advantage of a publicly provided good, leading to market  inefficiencies and goods being under-provided.</p>
<p>It has been <a href="https://www.academia.edu/37552359/Economics_of_the_Public_Sector_-_Joseph_E._Stiglitz">well documented</a> that when no charges are imposed on publicly provided goods, it imminently leads to overconsumption, and as a result, market disorganization.</p>
<h3><b>Addressing the &ldquo;roads are free for private vehicle consumers&rdquo; argument</b></h3>
<p>A lot of people tend to compare the metro with roads. A Wire piece argued that the road space was built entirely by public funds but disproportionately favoured private vehicle owners since it is virtually being used free of cost, and questioned why taxpayers complain that &lsquo;their money&rsquo; is being &lsquo;misused&rsquo; in &lsquo;freebies&rsquo; but don&rsquo;t do so when their funds are being used to build roads.</p>
<p>While it is true that roads are built using public funds, this argument is inherently flawed because roads are&mdash;at the end of the day&mdash;at everyone&rsquo;s disposal. Whether you choose private or public transport, everyone is entitled to road space. How one uses this resource is again within one&rsquo;s freedom and economic level. There exists no exclusive treatment to a specific section of the populace, unlike the metro plan.</p>
<p>Adding to that, we are compelled to make roads a public good&mdash;and therefore publicly funded&mdash;because it is non excludable, meaning it would be virtually impossible to restrict those who do not pay for roads from using it. It would be extremely expensive to have a toll booth and set up a collection system at every single road in the city.</p>
<h3><b>Bottomline</b></h3>
<p>It is not that positive discrimination should be opposed &mdash; in fact it is necessary in many ways for women upliftment &mdash; but bad economics and populist gimmicks must be called out before they cause market failures. With each announcement being made by Kejriwal (<a href="https://www.timesnownews.com/india/article/not-just-women-students-and-senior-citizens-to-get-free-rides-in-delhi-metro-as-well-hints-delhi-cm-kejriwal/448829">the recent</a> one being that the metro will be made free for students and senior citizens too), it is clear that is purely an electoral gimmick.</p>
<p>Considering the fact that the Delhi metro holds global standards for cleanliness and efficiency, making it free for such a large section of the populace could be absolutely destructive to its functioning, and must be heavily scrutinised by the general public before welcoming such a plan.</p>
