          <div class="mainText">
            <p ><span class="firstLetter">I</span>n a country like India where students are made to compete in a rat race for all things ranging from education to work opportunities, most people think getting there first is everything. The Indian way of thinking is so steadfast in the linear cycle of 'study-get a job-get your first salary' that concepts like the gap year are only seen to be detrimental to a students' progression. But interestingly, the West is showing us a different story: an increasing number of students are now opting to take a gap year, and a growing field of research tells us that they are benefiting from itâ€”leading us to ponder: What&rsquo;s it all about? Can it really help the Indian scenario as well?</p>
<h3><b>Disproving Gap Year Fallacies</b></h3>
<p >First and foremost, to discuss the gap year on rational grounds, we need to dismiss the prejudice surrounding the matter. A common misconception about the gap year is that it would ultimately demotivate students and discourage them to pursue higher education. But it turns out that <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970203513204576047723922275698" target="_blank">90%</a> of gap year students return to tertiary education within a year. Even more counterintuitively, a <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2010-15712-003" target="_blank">study</a> found out that gap year students were significantly more academically motivated than their non-gap year peers.</p>
<p >The stereotype that a gap year demotivates you and makes you lazy rises from the preconception that it is merely a break when one does not involve in any progressive activity. But a well-structured gap year which intends to aid in all-round skill and holistic development through engaging in activities such as traveling, interning, and volunteering can be extremely helpful in an individual's professional and personal life.</p>
<blockquote>
              <h3>
              <p>
                A study found out that gap year students were significantly more academically motivated than their non-gap year peers.
              </p>
              </h3>
            </blockquote>
<h3><b>A Year to Choose the Right Career</b></h3>
<p >Let's face it: schools, especially those with the Indian curriculum, do a horrible job in helping students explore what invigorates&nbsp;them and what they really want to pursue as a career. As a result, students are often pushed to conventional streams such as engineering and medicine irrespective of whether they are actually interested in it.&nbsp;</p>
<p >The problem here is that schools only expose students to the academic facet of a given field. The practical aspect and what it feels like to actually work in the sector is hardly covered. This needs to be rectified, and the only way to do that is to encourage students to experiment with different professions through interning in different sectors. Setting aside a specific time period to intern in order to make an informed career choice would then make sense.</p>
<p >Given that one's chosen career path will have an impact throughout one's life, spending a year to make such a crucial decision on what the path should be, must not be frowned upon, but encouraged.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>A Measure To Increase Employability</b></h3>
<p >Employability in the modern world isn't just defined by academic results. Students are now expected to have a myriad of soft skills such as the ability to lead, communicate, and have emotional intelligence. Educational institutions, again, fail in this regard. Rote school and college curriculums have only aided the student in progressing in academic theory, but are yet to address the development of soft skills on a larger scale.</p>
<p >A breather from this inefficient academic curriculum to engage in gap year activities such as volunteering and travelling could teach students to be more independent and mature; foster leadership skills; and communicate more effectively. Learning these "invisible" skills which have&nbsp;been so obscured by conventional curriculums could go a long way in increasing one's employability. Research only seems to agree with this; a <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/320983500_Review_on_the_Impact_of_Gap_Years_on_Career_Development" target="_blank">study</a> conducted on the impact of gap years on career development observed that 63% of the HR managers in the UK believe that participating in gap year activities help individuals perform better at work.&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
              <h3>

              </p>
              </h3>
            </blockquote>
<h3><b>Addressing the rising mental illness among students</b></h3>

<p >Mental illness is one of the most pressing issues threatening Indian students. <a href="https://www.asianjournalofpsychiatry.com/article/S1876-2018(15)30117-9/abstract" target="_blank">Research</a> published in the Asian Psychiatry Journal found that 53% of 700 randomly selected students were suffering from some form of depression. Regarding its causes, another study found that academic stress has increased drastically due to parental expectation and competitive environment among students. Clearly, we have a grave problem here: a large and increasing number of students are unhappy with their academical pursuit.&nbsp;</p>
<p >One of the ways we could approach the problem of the student mental health crisis is to rethink the way they transition from high school to tertiary education, which can be highly demanding and stressful.&nbsp; A purposeful break in adopting gap year programs between these two phases could greatly aid in students' personal growth and equip them with the ability to handle competitive environments and the mental stress that ensues. Gappers have reported to have significant developments in their personal life skills.</p>
<blockquote>
              <h3>
              <p>
                One of the ways we could approach the problem of the student mental health crisis is to rethink the way they transition from high school to tertiary education, which can be highly demanding and stressful.
              </p>
              </h3>
            </blockquote>
<p >We must stop dismissing the gap year concept with on the surface conclusions such as "It is bound to make people lazy", and start heeding rational observations from research and anecdotal experiences which are slowly proving the positive effects associated with a break from academic pursuits. The gap year could be greatly instrumental in restructuring how one would think of pursuing higher educationâ€”something that needs a massive revamp since a large number of students are now academically exhausted. In this fast-paced era where an increasing number of students are stressed and burned out, maybe all we need is a break that allows them to assess, reflect, and explore what they really want to do in order to live a purposeful life.</p>
