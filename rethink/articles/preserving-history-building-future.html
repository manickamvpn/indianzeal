          <div class="mainText">
            <p>On Monday April 15, 2019 the city of Paris was devastated by an unexpected catastrophe. The Catholic cathedral &ldquo;a masterpiece of composition and execution&rdquo; caught fire, causing the collapse of the spire and the oak roof, the two towers however escaped major damages. The fire devastated large parts of the 850-year-old building before it was finally extinguished after a nine-hour battle with included about 500 firefighters, one of whom was seriously injured.</p>
<p>The cause of the fire is still under investigation. The cathedral was undergoing renovations at the time of the fire. Scores of priceless artifacts were rescued from the flames, and were taken to the Louvre museum for safekeeping.</p>
<p>As one of the most visited monuments in the world with such a profound history, France entered into a moment of great despair, as did the rest of the world, who were quick to respond by offering their solidarity. Truly when such an event occurs it can truly shake the world. The French president Emmanuel Macron vowed to restore the church and remarkably after only two days the country had already received exorbitantly generous donations from its richest citizens. L'Oreal has promised 200 million euros on Tuesday, while the LVMH luxury goods group run by Bernard Arnault, the richest man in France, has pledged the same. Multi-billionaire Francois-Henri Pinault and oil company Total have also pledged 100 million euros each.</p>
<p>Now with such generosity one would be thankful and even admire such kindness in people to help a country in need. However, on the other side of the world the story is not the same. While others may applaud these men for their kindness many have called into question said acts. Where were all these people when historically black Louisiana churches were devastated in arson attacks or when countries like Mozambique, Zimbabwe and Malawi were recently hit with Idai, a cyclone causing major damage and thousands of casualties - no lives were lost in fire.</p>
<p>Now the question I would like to ask is, what is more important: salvaging history or working towards providing a more sustainable future for people? Quite frankly in my personal opinion the answer is not that simple, things are not so black and white. Looking at this particular case it is important to recognise and understand the history behind Notre Dame first. The medieval cathedral remains one of the most iconic buildings in the world and home to refined and irreplaceable artwork, as well as having served as a site for many momentous events along with it being a place of worship. On the other end, you have countries who have been devastated by natural disasters, others exposed to epidemics and subjected to extreme levels of poverty and not enough aid is being allocated. This recent event has sparked a lot of outrage especially within African nations who have been in dire need of financial aid in numerous instances. It is essential to understand that these countries do not have access to same resources to that of their European counterparts, the same countries that once overtook their lands and colonised them, setting them back centuries in terms of growth and development. The donations are being criticised because if in two days 1 billion dollars can be raised for a church why can't the same amount or even half be raised for the impoverished? We have seen a number of foundations and charities that have been set-up to help these people but never have we seen such a magnanimous response.</p>
<p>Another interesting argument raised by friends in Egypt was if the Great Pyramids were under attack, would we not expect the same responses? The problem here is not that the such people are being criticised for their mass donations to historic monuments of a world importance but rather the fact that such disposable money exists, such measures can be taken but only in cases like this. What about all of the existing poverty? What about all of the countries who are not host to such wealthy tycoons. Who will support them? Already large sums of money have been raised to restore the cathedral but do we see the same help being provided all around? Even within its own country reports of around 5,500 churches across France have been made with many needing urgent repairs yet no fund has been allocated. This is symbolic of the national divide. With increases in poverty by an alarming 21% and the rise of the Yellow Vest Movement the country or rather its leader is put into a very delicate position. &ldquo;Macron must be wary of inciting gilets jaunes further over Notre Dame.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With the promises made by Macron to rebuild the church in five years and make it &ldquo;even more beautiful'', it is left uncertain whether the cathedral will ever be same. With all of this, I believe the fire has ignited something even deeper into the people and has made several new revelations. &ldquo;How do we assess where our money would be best allocated? And should we be criticizing other people when they donate to causes we think are less important?&rdquo;</p>
